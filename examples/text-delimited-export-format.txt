This file should have no headers and each row should follow the below formatting with fix
width formatting.

In the row below for example the three inserted columns are;

- The event ID and or event number (created in firebase) which in this instance is
889 with the maximum column length being 4 digits.

- The second column is the student ID
which in this case is AB6124703 which will always be 9 digits.

- The last column is a 1 and is only 1 digit. it is always a 1 and its purpose is
basically a binary or boolean statement indicating to the student information system
to add that record and always immediately trails the student ID number.

***There are no headers included as you can see in the Event_889_111324.txt example, and that is intentional
the import process does not accept headers for these files.***

 Additionally, any errors or failures or duplicates need to be removed from the export file
 we are sending because they are not compatible with import anyways.

 I would also like another report (total of 3 attachments now if you are counting) to be sent
 with the Student ID, First, Last, email, and a timestamp of the scan date and time. the file name can be something
 like PS[Event Number]_SUMMARY_[Event Date].XLSX. Please make sure both of those functions are working.

Referenced example row below.
